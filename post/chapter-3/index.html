    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p><strong>Introduction</strong>
The price of an airline ticket is affected by a number of factors, such as flight distance, purchasing
time, fuel price, etc. Each carrier has its own proprietary rules and algorithms to set the price
accordingly. Recent advance in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) makes it
possible to infer such rules and model the price variation. The framework achieves a high prediction
accuracy with 0.869 adjusted R squared score on the testing dataset
Problem Variation and market trends?
According to Google Trends, the search term - &ldquo;Cheap Air Tickets&rdquo; is most searched in
India. Moreover, as the middle-class of India is exposed to air travel, consumers hunting for
cheap prices increases.</p>
<p><strong>Data Collection</strong>
Historical air flight prices are not readily available on the internet. Therefore the only option
that we have is to use some resources and collect data over a period of time. There is a
dataset on Kaggle that we have used in this project further we can also use
many APIs made available by companies like Amadeus, Sky Scanner. However, the number
of flights they returned for a domestic route in India are limited that’s why we used Kaggle
dataset.
Now an important aspect is to decide the parameters that might be needed for the
flight prediction algorithm.
Kaggle data set has numerous variables for each flight returned. However not all are
required and thus we selected the following -</p>
<ol>
<li>Origin City</li>
<li>Destination City</li>
<li>Departure Date</li>
<li>Departure Time</li>
<li>Arrival Time</li>
<li>Total Fare</li>
<li>Airway Carrier</li>
<li>Duration</li>
<li>Class Type - Economy/Business
10.Flight Number
11.Hopping - Boolean
12.Taken Date - date on which this data was collected
The dataset that we have used is only for they year 2019.
The kind of data that we have is very raw and needed a lot of work. For instance, the
price was a character type and not an integer. Moreover, for any model to work
efficiently, certain variables need to be introduced by combining or changing the
existing variables.
few basic cleaning and feature engineering looking at the data. A lot of data
preparation needs to be done according to the model and strategy we use, but here
are the basic cleaning we did initially to understand the data better:</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Duplicates</em>
There were not many, but a few repetitions in the data collected.
 Days to departure
Our objective is to optimize this parameter. This the difference is the
departure date and the day of booking the ticket. We consider this parameter
to be within 45 days.</p>
<p><em>Day of departure</em>
Intuitively we can say that flights scheduled during weekends will have a
higher price compared to the flights on Wednesday or Thursday. Since
including this in any of the models we use can be beneficial. We can also try
to include the month or if it is a holiday time for better accuracy.</p>
<p><em>Duration</em>
Converting the duration of the flight into numeric values, so that the model can
interpret it properly. Also, it will be fair enough to omit flights with a very long
duration.</p>
<p><em>Time of departure</em>
Similar to day of departure, the time also seem to play an important factor.
Hence we divided all the flights into three categories: Morning (6am to noon),
Evening (noon to 9pm) and Night (9pm to 6am)</p>
<p><em>Hoppings</em>
The data we collected did not give very authentic information about the
number of hops a journey takes. Hence, we calculated the hops using the
flight ids.</p>
<p><em>Outliers</em>
We are focusing on minimizing the flight prices, hence we considered only the
economy class with the following conditions:</p>
<p>a) The minimum value of total fare for all days for a particular flight id is less
than the mean fare of all the flights b) The duration of the journey is less than
3 times the mean duration.
Suppose a user makes a query to buy a flight ticket 44 days in advance, then our
system should be able to tell the user whether he should wait for the prices to
decrease or he should buy the tickets immediately. For this we have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Predict the flight prices for all the days between 44 and 1 and check on
which day the price is minimum.</li>
<li>Classify the data we already have into, “Buy” or “Wait”. This then becomes
a classification problem and we would need to predict only a binary number.
However, this does not give a good insight on the number of days to wait.
For the above example, if we choose the first method we would need to make a total
of 44 predictions (i.e. run a machine learning algorithm 44 times) for a single query.
This also cascades the error per prediction decreasing the accuracy. Hence,
the second method seems to be a better way to predict, wait or buy which is a
simple binary classification problem. But, in this method, we would need to predict
the days to wait using the historic trends.
For this we again have two options:</li>
<li>We do the predictions for each flight id. The problem with this is that, if
there is a change in flight id by the airline (which happens frequently) or there
is an introduction or a new flight for a specific route then our analysis would
fail.</li>
<li>We group the flight ids according to the airline and the time of
departure and do the analysis on each group. For this we need to combine
the prices of the airlines lying in that group such that the basic trend in
captured.
Moving ahead with the second option, we created the group according to the airlines
and the departure time-slot created earlier (Morning, Evening, Night) and calculated
the combined flight prices for each group, day of departure and depart day. Since
these three are the most influencing factors which determine the flight prices. Also,
we calculated the average number of flights that operated in a particular group, since
competition could also play a role in determining the fare.
Combining fare for the flights in one group:</li>
<li>Mean fare: This is the average of the fare of all the flights in a particular group
corresponding to departure day and days to departure. Because of high
standard deviation, taking the mean is not a very good option.</li>
<li>Minimum fare: This does not give a very good insight of the trend, as a
minimum value could occur because of some offer by an airline.</li>
<li>First Quartile: This is a good measure as we are focusing on minimizing the
fare and we do not want to consider the flights with high fares.</li>
<li>Custom Fare: This is the fare giving more weightage to recent price trend.
Total_customFare = w*(First Quartile for entire time period) + (1-
w)*(First quartile of last x days)
(We have considered: w = 0.7 and x = &amp; days)
Calculating whether to buy or wait for the this data:
Logical = 1 if for any d &lt; D the Total_customFare is less than the current
Total_customFare
(Here, d is the days to departure and D is the days to departure for the current row.)
The key components of the model are the training data and the testing data. The
way we built these data and the various aspects of the model that uses these
datasets is very tricky to understand. This flow chart will provide some basic
understanding.</li>
</ol>
<p>For a Regression problem, multiple algorithms can train the Regressor according to the data we have
and using the pattern, predict the outcomes of certain input conditions. We will try Linear
Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and and choose the algorithm best suited for our
data distribution. Once we build the model, we need to validate that model using values that are
never exposed to the model. Hence we split our data using train_test_split, a class provided by
Scikit-learn into 2 parts having a distribution of 80–20. The model is trained on 80% of data and
validated against the other 20% of the data. We can now train various models and compare the
performances. It is evident from the results that Lasso gives us a higher accuracy of 85% than other
algorithms for this data distribution. Even though the accuracy is not high enough to be useful, it
gives a basic idea about the strategies and methodologies used in designing a solution to the
Machine Learning problem and we have further used hyper tuning method randomized search cv
and grid search cv to improve the accuracy further. But we get more accuracy by using randomized
search cv because As random values are selected at each instance, it is highly likely that the whole of
action space has been reached because of the randomness, which takes a huge amount of time to
cover every aspect of the combination during grid search. This works best under the assumption that
not all hyperparameters are equally important. In this search pattern, random combinations of
parameters are considered in every iteration. The chances of finding the optimal parameter are
comparatively higher in random search because of the random search pattern where the model
might end up being trained on the optimised parameters without any aliasing. Then we have created
a pickle file for that model so that would act as a server to handle all the request form the front end.
Then we have written a python flask script to handle the users request and give back the request
after receiving output from the model. The user interface takes inputs li and it will predict the price
for the flight.
<strong>Conclusions from the Project</strong>
From the data collected and through exploratory data analysis, we can determine the
following:
On 2500 unique test cases, we saved total of 7 lakh rupees and lost 2 lakh rupees.
The trend of flight prices vary over various months and across the holiday There are two groups of airlines: the economical group and the luxurious
group. Spicejet, AirAsia, IndiGo, Go Air are in the economical class, whereas
Jet Airways and Air India in the other. Vistara has a more spread out trend.</p>
<p>The airfare varies depending on the time of departure, making timeslot used
in analysis an important parameter.</p>
<p>The airfare increases during a holiday season. In our time period, during
Diwali the fare remained high for all the values of days to departure. We
haven’t considered holiday season as a parameter now, since we are looking
at data for a few months.</p>
<p> Airfare varies according to the day of the week of travel. It is higher for
weekends and Monday and slightly lower for the other days.
 There are a few times when an offer is run by an airline because of which the
prices drop suddenly. These are difficult to incorporate in our mathematical
models, and hence lead to error.
 Along the Mumbai-Delhi route, we find that the price of flights
increases or remains constant as the days to departure decreases. This is
because of the high frequency of the flights, high demand and also could be
due to heavy competition.
 Only about 8-10% of the times, a person should wait according to the data
collected across the Mumbai-Delhi route, compared to 30-40% in DelhiGuwahati route</p>
